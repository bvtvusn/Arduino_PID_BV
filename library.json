  "description": "A PID controller is a feedback system used in industries to maintain a desired output. It adjusts the system based on the difference between the desired and actual values using three components: Proportional (P), Integral (I), and Derivative (D). These components help reduce errors, improve stability, and minimize oscillations, ensuring efficient control of processes.",
